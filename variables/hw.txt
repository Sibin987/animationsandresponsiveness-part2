is declaring variables in universal selector is same as global variables??

ans -> 1

:root is a pseudo selector that is equivalent to html 99% of the time, but with higher specificity (specificity equal to html + class).

:root selects the root element of the document based on it's format. It exists as CSS can be used in other document formats (SVG, XML).

* would apply the css to every element on the page. This is usually reserved for normalisation, fonts etc.
